Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts student math scores using demographic and academic features.  
It demonstrates a full end‑to‑end machine learning workflow:

- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- One‑hot encoding  
- Train/test split  
- Linear Regression model  
- Random Forest model  
- Model evaluation (MSE, RMSE)  
- Visualizations (scatter plot, heatmap, feature importance)

Key Findings
- **Random Forest** outperformed Linear Regression.
- Reading and writing scores were the strongest predictors.
- RMSE of ~2–3 means predictions are typically within a few points.

Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit‑Learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

- `student-performance-ml.ipynb` — full notebook  
- `StudentsUni_performance.csv` — dataset  
- `images/` — exported plots (optional)
